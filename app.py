        "story": """In a small coastal village, where the sea whispered secrets to the shore, there lived a curious boy named Arun. Every evening, as the sun dipped behind the hills and the sky turned shades of orange and violet, Arun would carry his little lantern and sit on the rocks, watching the restless waves dance under the fading light.

His lantern was old, with a glass chimney slightly cracked, but Arun cared for it as if it were a treasure. "One day, this light will help someone," he would whisper to himself, as the sea breeze tousled his hair.

One night, the sky darkened earlier than usual. Thick clouds rolled in, and the wind began to howl like a wild beast. The sea churned, waves slamming against the shore with fierce force. Arun, worried, held his lantern tighter and scanned the horizon.

Suddenly, through the curtain of rain and spray, he spotted a small fishing boat tossed about by the waves, its lantern barely visible. The boat's crew struggled to control it, fear written on their faces.

Without a second thought, Arun jumped onto the rocks, his lantern held high above his head. "Here! This way!" he shouted through the roar of the wind and water.

The captain of the boat saw the glow and turned the vessel toward the shore. The villagers, alerted by Arun's brave signal, ran to the beach with ropes and nets. Together, they pulled the boat safely onto land.

The captain, drenched but smiling, knelt down and embraced Arun. "You saved us," he said. "Your little lantern became our lighthouse."

From that day forward, Arun's lantern became more than just an object‚Äîit became a symbol of courage and kindness. Every evening, Arun continued to sit by the sea, his light shining steadily. The villagers often gathered around him, sharing stories, laughter, and warmth. And whenever a storm brewed on the horizon, Arun's lantern stood as a reminder that even the smallest light, held with love, can brighten the darkest night.""",

One afternoon, while flying it near the meadow, a sudden gust of wind tore the string and the kite soared away. Mira's heart sank as she watched it drift higher and higher, beyond the trees and far into the sky.

Feeling sad, she sat on a rock, staring at the empty sky. Just then, an old man passing by smiled gently. "Sometimes, letting go leads to something wonderful," he said.

The next morning, while walking through the meadow, Mira found her kite caught on a branch. But this time, instead of grabbing it, she smiled and left it there. She realized the wind had given her kite a chance to explore new heights.

From that day on, Mira made many more kites‚Äînot all stayed with her, but each one carried her dreams farther than she ever imagined.""",

Leo gently picked it up and wrapped it in his jacket. The puppy licked his cheek as if thanking him. He took it home, gave it warm milk, and made a little bed from an old blanket.

The next day, Leo asked his neighbors if the puppy belonged to anyone, but no one came forward. So he decided to keep it and named it ‚ÄúBuddy.‚Äù""",
